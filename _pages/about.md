Welcome! My name is Brooks, a computer science student at Quinnipiac University with a minor in game design. I am currently employed at Medicus Healthcare Solutions as an intern for the summer of 2024. As far as interests go, I am still unsure as to what specification in the computer science field I want to go into, however I am particularly intrigued by **machine learning**, **OPSEC** and **full-stack software development**.
